= Proton updater

Simple program to download the latest version of
https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/[GloriousEggroll's Proton fork]
and extract it to Steam's `compatibilitytools.d` folder.

Usage: proton-updater [--steam-dir /path/to/steam/directory]

If the Steam directory is not specified it defaults to `~/.steam`. If a new update is available, steam will
be shutdown prior to it being deployed. When the new version is installed -- or if there is no new version
available -- the updater will exit.

Future enhancements:

 - [ ] Remove old versions when updating
 - [ ] Support other Proton forks
 - [ ] Update Steam's config to specify the newer version
